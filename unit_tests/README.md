(Sort of) Unit Tests for the functions used in the continuous recognition task

These html are things I used to check if the functions used in the continous recognition task behave as I expected them to do.

It is not a real "unit test" per se, as nothing really gets tested, but I include them in the repository in case this is helpful for users to understand the inner working of the scripts. Note that there are docstrings/comment for each function in the scripts, which is not shown in the files here.
